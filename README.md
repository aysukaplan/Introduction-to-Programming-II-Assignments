# Introduction to Programming -II Java Assignments

This repository contains solutions for four assignments completed as part of the Introduction to Programming class, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java.

## Assignment 1: Online Book Marketing System

This assignment aims to provide a foundation in basic Java programming. The program involves handling variables, loops, string operations, and file reading operations.

## Assignment 2: Inheritance - Payroll Monitoring System

In this experiment, the task is to develop a system for monitoring the payroll of personnel in a university. The primary goal is to implement a solution using the inheritance mechanism in Java. This assignment emphasizes understanding the concept of inheritance, establishing relationships among classes, and controlling multiple instances of classes within the context of a university payroll system.

## Assignment 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism - Academic Course Management System

Develop an Academic Course Management System (ACMS) by applying inheritance and polymorphism concepts in object-oriented programming. Create a hierarchy of classes representing various roles within the academic program system, sharing common attributes and methods. Utilize polymorphism to enable different classes to exhibit unique behaviors through shared methods.

## Assignment 4: Stack and Queue Operations

Introduce data structures such as queues and stacks in this assignment. Perform operations based on commands from the `command.txt` file, updating data in `stack.txt` and `queue.txt`. Results are printed into `stackOut.txt` for the stack and `queueOut.txt` for the queue after each operation. Operations are : Remove Greater Number, Calculate Distance of Elements, Add or Remove Elements, Reverse Elements, Sorting Elements, Distinct Elements:
